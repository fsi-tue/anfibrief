we're happy you plan to begin your studies of \studiengang in Tübingen.
To facilitate your start to the studies, we're sending some information to help you get through the first weeks.
You'll receive further tips at our info days.

\textbf{Who or what is this \glqq student council\grqq?} We, the student council of computer science, are a few students from the subjects computer science, bioinformatics, media computer science, cognitive science and medical computer science, who commit themselves to the students' interests. Our work includes on one hand the representation of students in university bodies, on the other hand we try to facilitate the university life of our fellow students (i.e. beginners care,
events, mentoring, and so on).

We recommend participating at our beginners events, because the transition to master studies or from another university respectively often proves to be difficult. This way you get a first look into everyday life in Tübingen.

At our events there will be many older students who are willing to answer all your questions. You can find an overview of our events on the following pages.

In case you have questions prior to (or after) our events, you can reach us by mail at \texttt{fsi\At fsi.uni-tuebingen.de}
On our home page
\url{https://www.fsi.uni-tuebingen.de} you can already find helpful information about your studies. If you're interested in collaborating in the student council, just come to one of our meetings. The current date will be published on our web page.

We're looking forward to meeting you at our beginners events!\\
